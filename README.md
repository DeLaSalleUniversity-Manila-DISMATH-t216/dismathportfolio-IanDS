# Ian Delos Santos' Weekly Portfolio

#Week 1
- At our first day, I learned the background about our course Dicrete Math and I had a little background about our professor Mr. Melvin Cabatuan.
- My first impression for DISMATH was it will be easy because of the first example Sir Melvin showed us, but eventually this subject will really work up your mind.
- We discussed mathematical proofs, logical deductions, propositional statements and axioms.
- We also learned about logical connectives like negation, conjunctions, disjunctions, conditionals and biconditionals.

#Week 2
- This week we learned about Logical Equivalence which is similar to algebra.
- We learned about Arguments which are series of statements leading to a conclusion.
- We learned validity which follows the truth of succeeding premises.
-We learned about fallacies which are commonly accepted statements but are actually false.
-We learned Tautology which are statements that are always true.
- Sir Melvin also taught us quantifiers. Existential Quantifiers are true for most of the possible values and can easily be disproved. Universal Qunatifiers are true for all values and are hard to prove.

#Week 3
- We proved that superman does not exist. It was kind of hard it was a fun assignment.
- We learned about Rules of Inference and how our superman assignment was solved by it.
- We learned about Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens, Hypothetical Syllogism, Dysjunctive Syllogism, Addition, Simplification, Resolution and Conjunction.

#Week 4
- This week we learned about the different types of proof.
- First type of proof is Direct Proof:
     1st step: Assume p is true.
     2nd step: Show that q is also true by step 1
- Second type of proof is proof by Contraposition:
     1st step: Assume that "not q" is true
     2nd step: Show that "not p" is also true by step 1
- Third Type of proof is Vacuous Proof:
     1st step: Show that p is false
     2nd step: p implying q must be true
     3rd step; not p implying (p implying q)
- Fourth Type is Trivial proof:
     1st step: Show that q is true
     2nd step: p implying q must be true
     3rd step: q implying (p implying q)
- Fifth type is proof by Contradiction:
     1st step: Assume that "not" statement p is true
     2nd step: Show that step 1 will lead to a contradiction
     3rd step: Therefore, statement p is true
